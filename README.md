# CustomHomePage
A custom homepage to set as the home screen for your browser. The custom homepage shows a weather bar across the top of the screen. It also sets a nice background as well. The web page demonstrates the use of two different APIs, the OpenWeatherMap API, and the Pixabay API. The ultimate goal is to take this barebones, simple webpage, and turn it into a Chrome extension. As a chrome extension, many options would exist such as saving your weather location, loading different picture types as backgrounds, etc. Those options would be saved like the options you can configure in many extensions.
